# Quantum Information & QML Notes

Hi, Iâ€™m **Supalert Sukrakarn**, a theoretical physicist with a strong background in quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, and many-body systems. After working in academic research, Iâ€™ve transitioned my interest toward **Quantum Information (QI)** and **Quantum Machine Learning (QML)**.

This repository is a personal learning journal, where I review quantum theory from scratch while bridging it with modern quantum computing tools like **Qiskit** and **PennyLane**.

## ðŸ“Œ Goals

- Review and document quantum mechanics with both math and code
- Bridge theoretical physics and quantum computing frameworks
- Build intuition through visualization and circuit simulation
- Explore entanglement, quantum measurement, and multi-qubit systems
- Understand and experiment with QML architectures

---

##  Tools Used

- [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/)
- [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai/)
- Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, LaTeX
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Contents

Each notebook explores concepts both mathematically and visually, including:

- âœ… Qubit representation and Bloch sphere
- âœ… Quantum gates (Hadamard, Pauli, Rotation, U3, etc.)
- âœ… Measurement and projection
- ðŸ”œ Entanglement and Bell states
- ðŸ”œ Quantum circuits and QML examples
