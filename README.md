# Quantum Information & QML Notes

Iâ€™m **Supalert Sukrakarn**, a theoretical physicist who stepped out of academia about a year ago. Recently, Iâ€™ve found myself missing the beauty and depth of quantum mechanics â€” especially how it connects to modern tools like **Quantum Information (QI)** and **Quantum Machine Learning (QML)**.

This repository is a collection of self-study notes and experiments where I revisit quantum theory and explore its computational side through packages like **Qiskit** and **PennyLane**.

## Contents

Each notebook explores concepts both mathematically and visually, including:

- âœ… Qubit representation and Bloch sphere  
- âœ… Quantum gates (Hadamard, Pauli, Rotation, U3, etc.)  
- âœ… Measurement and projection into classical states  
- âœ… Visualization of quantum states using Qiskit  
- âœ… Basic circuit construction and measurement
