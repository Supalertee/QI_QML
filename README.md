# Quantum Information & QML Notes

Iâ€™m **Supalert Sukrakarn**, a theoretical physicist who stepped out of academia about a year ago. Recently, Iâ€™ve found myself missing the beauty and depth of quantum mechanics â€” especially how it connects to modern tools like **Quantum Information (QI)** and **Quantum Machine Learning (QML)**.

This repository is a collection of self-study notes and experiments where I revisit quantum theory and explore its computational side through packages like **Qiskit** and **PennyLane**.

## ðŸ“Œ Goals

- Review and document quantum mechanics with both math and code
- Bridge theoretical physics and quantum computing frameworks
- Build intuition through visualization and circuit simulation
- Explore entanglement, quantum measurement, and multi-qubit systems
- Understand and experiment with QML architectures

---

##  Tools Used

- [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/)
- [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai/)
- Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, LaTeX
- Jupyter Notebook

## Contents

Each notebook explores concepts both mathematically and visually, including:

- âœ… Qubit representation and Bloch sphere
- âœ… Quantum gates (Hadamard, Pauli, Rotation, U3, etc.)
- âœ… Measurement and projection
- ðŸ”œ Entanglement and Bell states
- ðŸ”œ Quantum circuits and QML examples
